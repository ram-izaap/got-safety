            <h2>Emergency Action Plan</h2>
            <b>INTRODUCTION:</b> The purpose of an Emergency Action Plan (“EAP”) is to create an organized procedure for employees and employers to follow in response to a workplace emergency or disaster. A well-developed plan, along with proper training, will prepare employees with the ability to evacuate an area quickly and safely, resulting in fewer and less severe injuries. OSHA requires a written emergency evacuation plan for every company, and it must be kept available in the workplace for employees to review. It is important to learn the emergency evacuation procedure for your immediate work area as well as other areas in the workplace that you may be in if an emergency occurs.
